A greedy algorithm makes a series of choices, each of which is locally optimal, with the hope of finding a global optimum. It builds up a solution incrementally, always choosing the best option available at each step.

Key Points:

1.Greedy Choice Property: Selecting a local optimum leads to a global optimum.
2.Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
