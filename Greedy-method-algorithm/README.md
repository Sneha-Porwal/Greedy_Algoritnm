# Greedy-method-algorithm
The greedy method is a strategy used in algorithms to solve optimization problems by making a series of choices, each of which looks the best at the moment. The goal is to find a global optimum by following a sequence of locally optimal choices.
Here are the main types of greedy approaches:
 1.Greedy Selection: At each step, choose the best available option based on a specific criterion.
 2.Greedy Exchange: Improve an existing solution by making local changes that enhance the solution.
 3.Greedy Inclusion: Iteratively add the next best element that seems to offer the most immediate benefit.
 4.Greedy Iteration: Repeatedly apply a greedy choice to build the solution incrementally.
Grredy Method:
1.Knapsack method
2.Job sequencing
3.Optimal merge pattern
4.optimal merge using linked list
